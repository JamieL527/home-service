# Blue Jays On air

A full-stack field operations and CRM platform for home service businesses. Digitizes the end-to-end workflow from lead collection → evaluation → sales pipeline → job assignment → execution → completion.

## Overview

The platform serves five distinct user roles across separate portals:

| Role | Portal | Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| **Admin** | `/admin` | User management, lead evaluation, job board, contractor approval, route task management, settings |
| **Sales** | `/sales` | CRM pipeline, deal management |
| **Marketing** | `/marketing` | Lead inbox, outreach tracking, contact qualification |
| **Data Collector** | `/collector` | Field lead collection with GPS, photos, OCR scanning |
| **Contractor** | `/contractor` | View job offers, accept/decline, update progress |

## Lead Lifecycle

```
Field Collection → Evaluation → Marketing Outreach → Sales Pipeline → Job Created → Assigned → Completed
     (Collector)     (Admin)        (Marketing)           (Sales)       (Admin)   (Contractor)
```

## Key Features

### Route Task Management
- Admin draws collection zones on Google Maps by clicking vertices to form polygons
- Zones assigned a color (10 presets) and linked to a Zone for team scoping
- Task statuses: Unassigned → Claimed → In Progress → Completed
- First-accept-wins claim system with DB transaction to prevent race conditions
- Admin can rename tasks inline, force-release a claimed task, or delete
- Collector sees available tasks in their zone, accepts, collects leads, marks done
- Cancel allowed if no leads submitted yet; task returns to the pool
- Lead count per task visible to admin in real time
- Collector's new-lead map shows their active task polygon as a visual boundary
- Submitting first lead auto-advances task from Claimed → In Progress

### Data Collector (Mobile-first)
- GPS pin drop + reverse geocoding for precise job site location
- Multi-category photo upload (Site / Demand / Supply / Other)
- OCR text scanning via Google Vision — auto-extracts phone, email, company, address
- Voice-to-text field notes
- City permit data auto-lookup by address (matched against municipal `permits` table)
- Offline-friendly: photos upload in background with local preview

### Admin Evaluation
- Lead queue with Urgent / Backed / New / Needs Fix / Resubmitted states
- One-click actions: Back, Urgent, Send to Marketing, Park, Delay, Needs Fix
- Reviewer comments fed back to collector for correction

### Marketing Inbox
- Kanban board: To Contact → Contacting → No Response → Contact Established
- Sentiment tags, follow-up dates, retry tracking
- Qualify lead → auto-creates Sales Deal

### Sales Pipeline
- Drag-free CRM board across deal stages
- Deal value, deadlines, project type tracking

### Job Management
- Fill job details (scope, price type, service type, timeline)
- Contractor matching scored by trade type + address proximity
- Job offer flow: Send → Contractor Accept/Decline → Assigned
- Progress notes and photos from contractor
- Admin verification on completion

### Contractor Portal
- View offers with partial address (privacy — full address revealed after acceptance)
- Accept / Decline offers
- Start job, mark complete, add progress notes

## User Invitation Flow

Admins invite internal users (Sales / Marketing / Data Collector) from `/admin/users`:

1. Admin fills email + role (+ optional Zone for Data Collectors)
2. Supabase sends invite email
3. User clicks link → `/accept-invite` → `/set-password` → redirected to their dashboard

## Contractor Registration Flow

1. `/register` — email + password
2. `/register/business-profile` — business info, trade type, insurance, T&C
3. `/register/pending` — awaiting admin approval
4. Admin approves → contractor accesses `/contractor/overview`
